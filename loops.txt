Possible use cases for a for loop
---------------------------------
- used often if you're iterating over a fixed length
- can be useful if you want to iterate sequentially, or in intervals, because you can set that up in the beginning

Possible use cases for a while loop
-----------------------------------
- used often if all you want to keep track of is whether a specific condition is true
- used often when you don't know how many iterations something will take

initializer = ___
while conditional:
  # block of code
# the block of code will run over and over as long as the conditional expression evaluates to true
